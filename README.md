## Reflection

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**  
I can ensure functionality and security by writing unit tests, running them regularly, and using code reviews and automated testing tools. Secure coding practices, input validation, and following industry standards also help reduce vulnerabilities.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**  
I interpret user needs by carefully analyzing requirements and translating them into technical tasks. I focus on clarity in the requirements and prioritize features that directly address user goals while keeping usability in mind.

**How do I approach designing software?**  
I approach software design by breaking the problem into smaller components, planning data structures and interactions first, then gradually building and testing. I also consider scalability, maintainability, and clarity to ensure the design can be extended and improved over time.
